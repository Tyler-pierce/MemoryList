MemoryList - Memcached based data structure.


See files for detailed comments, main intent:

General library to store large amounts of data in memcache and be able to easily query, persistently traverse and aggregate it.  Potential and currently tested uses below.


Main features:
* Query modifiers: limit / offset.
* Waypoints: keep multiple waypoints to persistently iterate through the stream.
* Abstraction points available for storing to other medium like mysql, compatible with waypoints and modifiers.
* Aggregation: frees memory and aggregates data best as possible where similar, or to a max level (aggregate maximum 10 duplicate entries)
* Multi-Query: maintain and query multiple streams to get results sorted by time.


Potential Uses:
* Real time stat keeping/viewing.
* Very easy to implement notification system like friends actions on a website.
* Temporarily store app/stat data for many users with periodic dumps to disk.
* Chat system. Not an ideal use case but I've done it for fun :)
