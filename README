MemoryList - Memcached based data structure.


See files for detailed comments, main intent:

General library to store large amounts of data in memcache and be able to
easily query and aggregate it.  Try to ensure concurrency safety and reliability
best as reasonable for memcache.  See potential uses below for better picture.

Main features:

- Query modifiers: limit / offset / waypoints (for incrementally updating your view)
- Aggregation: frees memory and aggregates data best as possible where similar, or to
a max level (aggregate maximum 10 duplicate entries)
- Multi-Query: maintain and query multiple structures to get time sorted results (under
construction)


Potential Uses:

- Real time stat keeping/viewing (first production use will be tracking likes in real time
for site with 50,000,000 monthly uniques, stay tuned)

- Temporarily store app data for many users with periodic persistant storage (at your own risk,
obviously it won't keep that safe for ya!).  I suggest double writing to 2 memcache instances
as a start.

- Functionality similar to facebooks notifications.
